- ❌ **Specialty Standards**: Define standards for each specialty

#### 4. Documentation and Testing (Partially Complete)

- ⏳ **Migration Documentation**: Update with complete migration details
- ❌ **Example Implementations**: Create comprehensive examples of Deal framework usage
- ❌ **Test Suite**: Implement full test suite based on migration specifications

## Integration Points

The migrated components integrate with the existing HMS-A2A framework through the following mechanisms:

1. **Package Structure**: All components follow the HMS-A2A package structure conventions
2. **Module Integration**: Domain-specific modules can be imported and used independently
3. **Standards Registry**: Standards validation is available across all components
4. **Tool Registration**: MCP tools are registered with a central registry for discovery
5. **Collaboration Framework**: The deals framework provides a unified collaboration mechanism

## Implementation Details

### Deal Framework

The Deal framework is implemented as a graph-based system where:

- **Deals** represent collaboration contexts
- **Problems** represent challenges to solve
- **Solutions** represent proposed approaches
- **Players** represent participating agents
- **Transactions** represent exchanges between players

The graph relationships are implemented using NetworkX, replacing the RGL-based implementation from the Ruby version in HMS-SME.

### Standards Validation

The standards validation framework provides:

- A registry of standards and validation rules
- Methods to validate content against standards
- Violation tracking and severity assessment
- Recommendations for addressing compliance issues

### MCP Tools

Each domain-specific tool follows the MCP pattern:

- Clearly defined input parameters
- Validation against domain-specific standards
- Structured output with relevant metadata
- Registration with the central tool registry

## Comparison to HMS-SME

| Feature | HMS-SME Implementation | HMS-A2A Implementation |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Deal Framework | Ruby with RGL graph library | Python with NetworkX |
| Standards Validation | TypeScript with JSON schema | Python with custom validator |
| MCP Tools | TypeScript | Python with decorator-based registration |
| Collaboration | Mixed Ruby/TypeScript | Pure Python |
| Integration | Manual wiring | Package-based imports |
