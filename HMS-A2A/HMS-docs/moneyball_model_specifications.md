### 2.2. Interfaces

**Neural Network to Win-Win Calculation:**
```python
# Value generated by neural network must be processable by win-win calculation
network_value = generate_deal_value(deal)
entity_values = calculate_entity_values(network_value, entities)
is_win_win = all(value > 0 for value in entity_values.values())
```

**Win-Win Calculation to Monitoring System:**
```python
# Win-win calculation results must feed into monitoring system
entity_values = calculate_entity_values(deal_value, entities)
metrics = create_metrics_from_values(entity_values)
monitoring_system.track_metrics(deal_id, metrics)
```

**Monitoring System to O3 Optimization:**
```python
# Monitoring data must inform optimization process
performance_data = monitoring_system.get_deal_performance(deal_id)
optimizer = O3Optimizer(hypergraph)
revised_deal = optimizer.optimize_deal_based_on_performance(deal_id, performance_data)
```

**O3 Optimization to Implementation:**
```python
# Optimization results must guide implementation process
optimization_results = optimizer.optimize_roadmap(entities)
deployment_plan = create_deployment_plan_from_optimization(optimization_results)
deploy_model(deployment_plan)
```

## 3. Performance Requirements

### 3.1. Computational Efficiency

- O3 optimization should complete within 30 seconds for standard-sized problems
- Neural network processing should handle at least 1000 nodes across all layers
- Win-win calculations should process at least 100 entity-value pairs per second
- Monitoring system should handle real-time updates from at least 50 concurrent deals

### 3.2. Accuracy

- Deal Value Function should produce values within 5% of manual calculations
- Win-win determination should have zero false positives (no deals with negative value marked as win-win)
- O3 optimization should find solutions within 10% of theoretical optimal value

### 3.3. Scalability

- System should scale to handle at least 1,000 agencies
- Each agency should support at least 100 concurrent deals
- Documentation updates should process at least 10 agencies per minute

## 4. Validation Framework

### 4.1. Test Cases

**Basic Value Calculation:**
```python
# Test with known inputs and expected outputs
test_deal = create_test_deal(...)
expected_value = 100.0
actual_value = calculate_deal_value(test_deal)
assert abs(actual_value - expected_value) < 0.01
```

**Win-Win Verification:**
```python
# Test with deliberately imbalanced deal
imbalanced_deal = create_imbalanced_deal(...)
is_win_win, entity_values = verify_win_win(imbalanced_deal)
assert not is_win_win
assert any(value <= 0 for value in entity_values.values())

# Test with balanced deal
balanced_deal = create_balanced_deal(...)
is_win_win, entity_values = verify_win_win(balanced_deal)
assert is_win_win
assert all(value > 0 for value in entity_values.values())
```

**Optimization Effectiveness:**
```python
# Test optimization with suboptimal deal
suboptimal_deal = create_suboptimal_deal(...)
optimized_deal = optimizer.optimize_deal(suboptimal_deal.id)
assert calculate_deal_value(optimized_deal) > calculate_deal_value(suboptimal_deal)
```

### 4.2. Integration Tests

**End-to-End Process:**
```python
# Test full process flow
deal = create_moneyball_deal(...)
is_win_win = verify_win_win(deal)
if not is_win_win:
    deal = optimizer.optimize_deal(deal.id)
    is_win_win = verify_win_win(deal)
assert is_win_win
monitoring_system.track_deal(deal.id)
alerts = monitoring_system.get_alerts(deal.id)
assert len(alerts) == 0
```

### 4.3. Documentation Tests

**Agency Integration:**
```python
# Test documentation integration
agency_file = "path/to/agency_file.md"
original_content = read_file(agency_file)
update_agency_docs.update_file(agency_file)
updated_content = read_file(agency_file)
assert "Moneyball Deal Model" in updated_content
assert len(updated_content) > len(original_content)
```
