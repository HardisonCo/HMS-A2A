# Chapter 11: AI Governance Values Layer

*(From [AI Agent Framework (HMS-AGT / HMS-AGX)](10_ai_agent_framework__hms_agt___hms_agx__.md) you now have eager AI ‚Äúinterns‚Äù ready to work.  
But before they touch real citizen data, we must ask: **Do they follow the rules?**  
The AI Governance Values Layer is the automated ‚Äúvalues inspector‚Äù that says *yes* or *no*.)*

---

## 1. Why Do We Need a Values Layer? üõ°Ô∏è

### Central Use-Case  
The **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** launches a chatbot that:

1. Reads a filer‚Äôs return from HMS-DTA.  
2. Explains deductions in plain English.  
3. Suggests missing tax credits.

Public expectations:

* **Transparency** ‚Äì ‚ÄúTell me how you reached that suggestion.‚Äù  
* **Truth** ‚Äì ‚ÄúNo hallucinated deductions.‚Äù  
* **Safety** ‚Äì ‚ÄúNever reveal someone else‚Äôs SSN.‚Äù  
* **Ethics** ‚Äì ‚ÄúStay neutral; no biased language.‚Äù  
* **Privacy** ‚Äì ‚ÄúUse data only for this session.‚Äù

If any rule is broken, the IRS risks legal action.  
The **AI Governance Values Layer** applies these checks **automatically**, the same way Section 508 scanners protect accessibility.

## 2. Key Concepts (Plain English)

| Term | Beginner Analogy | Why It Matters |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Values Checklist | TSA carry-on rules | Blocks forbidden items (data, words, biases) |
| Explainability API | Baggage X-ray screen | Shows what‚Äôs inside the model‚Äôs answer |
| Data Certificate | Boarding pass | Proves training data met privacy rules |
| Ethics Linter | Spell-checker for values | Flags biased or unsafe text before reply |
| Privacy Budget | Frequent-flyer miles | Limits how much personal data an agent can reveal per user |
| Audit Stamp | Customs stamp | Immutable proof the check was done |

---

## 3. Five-Minute Quick-Start

We will wrap an existing **TaxHelpBot** (from Chapter 10) with a **`values_guard`** decorator.  
Under 20 lines each!

### 3.1  Install the Guard

```bash
pip install hms-values
```

### 3.2  Add a 12-Line Policy File

```yaml
# values_policy.yaml
checklist:
  - no_pii           # block SSN, EIN, etc.
  - factual_claims   # require citation
  - unbiased_language
explainability: on
privacy_budget: 3   # max personal facts per session
```

### 3.3  Protect the Agent (17 lines)

```python
# tax_bot_guarded.py
from agt import Agent
from hms_values import values_guard

bot = Agent.load("TaxHelpBot.yml")   # from Chapter 10

@values_guard("values_policy.yaml")  # ‚Üê new line
def safe_reply(msg):
    return bot.reply(msg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        print("ü§ñ", safe_reply(input("üë§ ")))
```

**What happens?**  
1. `values_guard` loads the checklist.  
2. Every answer passes through ethics & privacy linting.  
3. If something fails, the bot is muted and an **Audit Stamp** is saved.

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as Filer
  participant UI as IRS Portal
  participant GW as API Gateway
  participant VG as Values Guard
  participant AG as TaxHelpBot
  participant AUD as Audit Log

  User->>UI: "Can I deduct my home office?"
  UI->>GW: POST /chat
  GW->>VG: forward question
  VG->>AG: ask bot
  AG-->>VG: draft answer
  VG-->>AUD: stamp (pass/ fail)
  VG-->>GW: clean answer or error
  GW-->>UI: reply
```

*Only 1 extra hop (Values Guard) between the portal and the agent.*

## 5. Under-the-Hood Code Peeks

### 5.1  The Decorator (18 lines)

```python
# hms_values/decorator.py
import yaml, functools
from .linter import lint
from .audit  import stamp

def values_guard(policy_path):
    rules = yaml.safe_load(open(policy_path))
    def wrap(fn):
        @functools.wraps(fn)
        def inner(msg):
            answer = fn(msg)
            issues = lint(answer, rules)
            stamp(msg, answer, issues)       # save to ledger
            if issues:                       # any rule failed?
                return "‚ö†Ô∏è Sorry, answer blocked by AI governance."
            return answer
        return inner
    return wrap
```

**Beginner takeaway:** the guard is just a Python wrapper that:

1. Runs `lint()` for each rule.  
2. Calls `stamp()` to log result.  
3. Returns the safe answer *or* blocks it.

### 5.2  Ethics Linter Core (15 lines)

```python
# hms_values/linter.py
BANNED_PII = ["SSN", "EIN", "passport"]

def lint(text, rules):
    issues = []
    if "no_pii" in rules["checklist"]:
        for word in BANNED_PII:
            if word.lower() in text.lower():
                issues.append("PII detected")
    if "unbiased_language" in rules["checklist"]:
        if "lazy taxpayer" in text.lower():
            issues.append("Bias detected")
    # ...more checks...
    return issues
```

### 5.3  Audit Stamp Writer (14 lines)

```python
# hms_values/audit.py
import csv, uuid, datetime
def stamp(question, answer, issues):
    with open("values_audit.csv", "a") as f:
        csv.writer(f).writerow([
            uuid.uuid4(),                 # stamp id
            datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
            bool(issues),                 # pass/fail
            len(issues),
            question[:40],
            answer[:40]
        ])
```

Every entry is one CSV line‚Äîeasy to ship to HMS-DTA later.

## 6. How the Values Layer Connects to Other HMS Parts

| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| [Three-Layer Governance Model](01_three_layer_governance_model_.md) | Values rules live on the **Governance Floor**; Guards enforce on **Management Floor** |
| [Backend API Gateway](06_backend_api_gateway_.md) | Optionally runs `values_guard` as middleware for non-AI APIs |
| [AI Agent Framework](10_ai_agent_framework__hms_agt___hms_agx__.md) | Agents call guards locally or via side-car |
| [Model Context Protocol (HMS-MCP)](13_model_context_protocol__hms_mcp__.md) | Passes policy metadata into fine-tuning jobs |
| [Human-in-the-Loop Oversight](12_human_in_the_loop__hitl__oversight_.md) | HITL dashboards read `values_audit.csv` for review queues |

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Quick Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fast Remedy |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| All answers blocked | Checklist too strict | Comment out rule in `values_policy.yaml` and rerun |
| ‚ÄúFileNotFoundError: values_policy.yaml‚Äù | Wrong path | Use absolute path or keep file next to script |
| Guards slow down responses | Heavy explainability on | Set `explainability: off` during dev |

---

## 8. Hands-On Exercise (10 min)

1. `git clone https://github.com/hms-samples/values-demo && cd values-demo`  
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run `python tax_bot_guarded.py`  
4. Ask: ‚ÄúWhat is my SSN?‚Äù ‚Üí bot should block the answer.  
5. Open `values_audit.csv`; see a new line with `pass/fail = True` (blocked).  
6. Change `privacy_budget: 1` in `values_policy.yaml`, restart, and observe budget exhaustion after one personal fact.

## 9. Recap & What‚Äôs Next

You learned how the **AI Governance Values Layer**:

‚Ä¢ Codifies transparency, truth, safety, ethics, and privacy into a **checklist**.  
‚Ä¢ Wraps any agent or API with a 1-line decorator.  
‚Ä¢ Logs every decision with an **Audit Stamp** for inspectors.  
‚Ä¢ Integrates smoothly with gateways, workflows, and human oversight.

Next we will see how **real humans** step in when the guard raises a flag:
