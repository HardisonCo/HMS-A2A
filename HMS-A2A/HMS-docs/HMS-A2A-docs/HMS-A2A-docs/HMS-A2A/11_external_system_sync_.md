# Chapter 11: External System Sync
[‚Üê Back to Chapter 10: AI Governance Layer (Transparency, Ethics, Safety, Privacy)](10_ai_governance_layer__transparency__ethics__safety__privacy__.md)

## 1. Why Do We Need a ‚ÄúData Bridge‚Äù?

Imagine **Camila**, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  
She updates a veteran‚Äôs allergy record inside the hospital EHR.  
Minutes later the same veteran requests a **disability-benefit increase** through HMS.  
If HMS still thinks the veteran can take penicillin, a bad decision (and a worse medical prescription) could follow.

Problem:  
‚Ä¢ The EHR lives **outside** HMS in a locked-down hospital network.  
‚Ä¢ Manual nightly CSV exports are too slow.  
‚Ä¢ VA policy says no direct DB access allowed.

**External System Sync** solves this by acting as the *real-time bridge* between HMS and any outside system‚Äîwhether it speaks webhooks, SFTP, or cold-war-era message queues.

## 2. Key Concepts in Plain English

| Concept | Everyday Analogy | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Webhook** | Post Office ‚ÄúChange of Address‚Äù card‚Äîsystem mails you the update | Instant push; no polling |
| **Message Queue** | Airport baggage carousel | Handles bursts without dropping bags |
| **Secure File Drop** | Locked drop-box outside a courthouse | Works even for legacy mainframes |
| **Adapter** | Plug converter for U.S. ‚Üî EU outlets | Translates data formats (XML ‚áÑ JSON) |
| **Health Ping** | Daily ‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK‚Äù text from a hiking friend | Detects silent link failures |

Keep these five in mind; we‚Äôll use them in the example.

## 3. Use Case Walk-Through  
**Goal:** When the VA EHR updates an allergy, HMS receives the change within seconds.

### 3.1 20-Second ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù (Node, 18 lines)

```js
// file: ehr_webhook.js
import express from 'express';
import { sendToQueue } from '@hms/ext-sync';

const app = express().use(express.json());

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ VA EHR calls this URL on every update
app.post('/webhook/ehr', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;                 // { vetId, allergy, ts }
  await sendToQueue('va.ehr.allergies', payload);  // fan-out inside HMS
  res.sendStatus(202);
});

app.listen(8080, () => console.log('üåâ  Bridge listening'));
```

Explanation  
1. VA‚Äôs EHR is configured to POST to `/webhook/ehr`.  
2. `sendToQueue()` hands the message to HMS‚Äôs internal **RabbitMQ** topic `va.ehr.allergies`.  
3. Any HMS micro-service (e.g., Benefits Calculator) can subscribe with zero extra code.

## 4. Zooming Out: What Really Happens?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EHR as VA EHR
    participant BRG as Sync Bridge
    participant MQ  as Message Queue
    participant SVC as HMS Service
    EHR->>BRG: POST /webhook/ehr
    BRG->>MQ: publish(allergy)
    MQ-->>SVC: deliver(allergy)
```

Four actors‚Äîsimple enough for day-one engineers.

---

## 5. Under the Hood (Tiny But Tasty Code)

### 5.1 Queue Helper (TypeScript, 15 lines)

```ts
// file: lib/queue.ts
import amqp from 'amqplib';

let chan: amqp.Channel;

export async function init(url = process.env.AMQP_URL) {
  const conn = await amqp.connect(url);
  chan = await conn.createChannel();
}

export async function publish(topic: string, msg: object) {
  if (!chan) await init();
  chan.assertExchange('hms', 'topic', { durable: true });
  chan.publish('hms', topic, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(msg)), {
    persistent: true
  });
}
```

Used by the bridge‚Äôs `sendToQueue()` wrapper‚Äînothing for integrators to tweak.

### 5.2 Legacy Fallback: Secure File Drop (Bash, 10 lines)

```bash
# file: nightly_pull.sh
sftp va_mainframe:/outgoing/claims_$(date +%F).csv \
     ./drops/claims.csv

hms-cli file-sync \
  --src ./drops/claims.csv \
  --adapter csv2json \
  --queue va.claims.nightly
```

When a system can‚Äôt push webhooks, HMS **pulls** a file and re-queues it.

---

## 6. Health & Alerting

1. Every adapter sends an hourly **Health Ping** to the HMS monitoring topic `ext.health`.  
2. AI Representative Agent ([Chapter 3](03_ai_representative_agent__hms_a2a__.md)) watches these pings; missing two in a row triggers a proposal:  
   ‚ÄúSwitch VA allergy sync to *fail-open* fallback (read-only).‚Äù

---

## 7. First-Time Integration Checklist

| Step | Action | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Choose mode: Webhook, Queue, or File Drop | 1 min |
| 2 | Install SDK: `npm i @hms/ext-sync` | 30 s |
| 3 | Register external system in HMS-GOV UI ‚Üí *Connections* | 1 min |
| 4 | Configure secrets (`AMQP_URL`, SFTP creds) in K8s | 2 min |
| 5 | Ship a test message & watch in ‚ÄúLive Stream‚Äù dashboard | 30 s |

Total ‚âà **5 minutes**.

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1. **Clock Skew**  
   ‚Ä¢ EHR timestamps in UTC-5, HMS in UTC‚Äîalways convert to ISO-8601.  
2. **Message Storms**  
   ‚Ä¢ Set queue TTL; old allergy changes expire after 24 h.  
3. **Silent Failures**  
   ‚Ä¢ Rely on Health Pings, not human memory.  
4. **Giant CSVs**  
   ‚Ä¢ Split into 10 MB chunks; stream each into the queue.

---

## 9. Where This Fits in the HMS Puzzle

* Data enters through **External System Sync**, **then** gets governed by the privacy controls from [Chapter 9](09_data_privacy___compliance_framework_.md).  
* AI Agents use the fresh data to draft policy tweaks and pass them through [HITL Oversight](04_human_in_the_loop__hitl__oversight_.md).  
* Every sync message carries a Provenance Stamp consumed by the [AI Governance Layer](10_ai_governance_layer__transparency__ethics__safety__privacy__.md).

---

## 10. Recap & What‚Äôs Next

You now know how to:

* Bridge **any** outside system‚Äîmodern or mainframe‚Äîto HMS.  
* Pick the right sync mode (Webhook, Queue, File Drop).  
* Wire a 18-line Node script that publishes real-time updates.  
* Monitor health and let AI act on outages.

In the next chapter we‚Äôll learn how HMS decides **when to retire or auto-scale** parts of the system based on live performance:  
[Chapter 12: Autonomous Performance & Replacement Logic](12_autonomous_performance___replacement_logic_.md)

*Real-time data in, smarter government out‚Äîone bridge at a time.*
