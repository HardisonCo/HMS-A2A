# HMS-A2A – Communication Plan

## 1. Title & Purpose
Describes how A2A request changes, statuses, and incidents are communicated among dev teams and relevant stakeholder apps, plus escalation procedures with HPC if used.

## 2. Communication Channels & Protocols
• Slack: #hms-a2a-dev, for developer support.
• Could also have a separate #hms-a2a-integrators for external subsystem teams.
• Email alerts or queue-based notifications for major system updates.

## 3. Stakeholder Matrix
Role | Person/Team
---- | -------------------------
Dev Lead | Cameron Li
Integration SMEs | Subsystem Owners
QA | QA Team
Ops | DevOps & HPC Ops

## 4. Incident Escalation & Cut-Over Plans
• If A2A service is down, fallback is manual data-sharing or direct API calls.
• On-call rotation for dev/ops if HPC transformations fail.

## 5. Integration with Master Communication Plan
• The A2A service is part of wave 2 for cross-HMS integration.
• Timelines are aligned with HPC expansions if large data sets are expected.

## 6. Roadmap & Updates
• Next iteration: multi-step request flows, partial data deliveries.
• HPC-based transformations for structured/unstructured data.
