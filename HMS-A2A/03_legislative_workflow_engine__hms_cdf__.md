# Chapter 3: Legislative Workflow Engine (HMS-CDF)

*(From [Chapter 2: Government Admin Portal (HMS-GOV)](02_government_admin_portal__hms_gov__.md) you saw Emma ‚Äúapprove & publish‚Äù a shipping schedule.  
But **where did the schedule‚Äôs legal authority come from?**  
That story starts here.)*

## 1. Why a Workflow Engine for Laws? üó≥Ô∏è

Imagine the **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** wants a new rule:  
‚ÄúEvery federally-funded apartment must install smart smoke detectors.‚Äù

The journey looks like this:

```
Draft üìù  ‚Üí  Committee Review üßê  ‚Üí  Floor Vote üó≥Ô∏è  ‚Üí  Enactment ‚úÖ
```

Historically, each phase lived in different email threads or PDFs‚Äîeasy to lose, hard to audit.

**HMS-CDF** (Codified Document Flow) is the digital clerk that:

1. Tracks every amendment like Git tracks code.  
2. Stops a rule from moving forward until all required steps pass.  
3. Emits machine-readable events so portals, bots, or external systems stay in sync.

Result: Agencies can **simulate**, **test**, or even **auto-promulgate** regulations without violating procedure.

## 2. Key Ideas in Plain English

| Term | Think of it as‚Ä¶ | ‚öñÔ∏è  Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Docket | A folder for one policy | Holds all versions & comments |
| Phase | ‚ÄúSwim lane‚Äù in the process | Draft ‚Üí Committee ‚Üí Vote ‚Üí Enact |
| Amendment | A pull-request on the docket | Must be voted in before merge |
| Guard-Rail Checker | A referee | Verifies quorum, signatures, etc. |
| Audit Ledger | Black box flight recorder | Immutable proof for courts |

---

## 3. Quick-Start: Create & Walk a Policy Through the Phases

Below is a **Rust-based CLI** shipped with HMS-CDF.  
(Beginner note: you don‚Äôt need to know Rust to follow along.)

### 3.1. Create a Docket

```bash
$ hms-cdf new "Smart Smoke Detector Rule"
‚úîÔ∏è  Docket #42 created in ./dockets/42
```

Explanation: Generates a folder `dockets/42/` with a `policy.yml` skeleton.

### 3.2. Add an Amendment

```bash
$ hms-cdf amend 42 --file fix_dates.patch
Amendment A1 queued for Committee Review
```

The engine **refuses** to jump ahead until Committee signs off.

### 3.3. Simulate a Vote

```bash
$ hms-cdf advance 42
üîé  Guard-Rail: quorum = 8/10  ...OK
üó≥Ô∏è  Vote result: 7 Y / 1 N  ...PASSED
üì¶  Phase moved to Enactment
```

All three console outputs come from the Guard-Rail Checker.

```

CDF owns **policy truth**; everyone else just reads or executes it.

## 5. How Emma‚Äôs ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù Button Talks to HMS-CDF

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as HMS-GOV UI
  participant API as GOV-API
  participant CDF as HMS-CDF
  participant DB as Ledger-DB

  UI->>API: POST /dockets/42/advance
  API->>CDF: advance(42)
  CDF->>DB: append ledger entry
  CDF-->>API: {status: "Enactment"}
  API-->>UI: 200 OK
```

Key points:

1. UI never hits CDF directly‚ÄîManagement Floor mediates.  
2. Ledger append is atomic; if it fails, phase doesn‚Äôt change.

## 6. Peek Under the Hood (Rust ‚â§ 20 lines each)

### 6.1. Finite-State Machine

```rust
// src/fsm.rs
use crate::Phase::*;
#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum Phase { Draft, Committee, Vote, Enactment }

pub fn next(current: Phase) -> Phase {
    match current {
        Draft     => Committee,
        Committee => Vote,
        Vote      => Enactment,
        Enactment => Enactment, // terminal
    }
}
```

Beginner takeaway: A simple `match` decides the only legal ‚Äúnext stop.‚Äù

### 6.2. Guard-Rail Checker

```rust
// src/guard.rs
pub fn check_quorum(votes: usize, members: usize) -> Result<()> {
    if votes * 2 >= members * 3 { Ok(()) }     // 2/3 quorum
    else { Err("Quorum not met".into()) }
}
```

Notice the logic is transparent & auditable‚Äîone reason HMS-CDF uses Rust.

### 6.3. Ledger Append

```rust
// src/ledger.rs
pub fn record(event: &str, docket: u32) -> Result<()> {
    let line = format!("{docket},{timestamp},{event}\n");
    std::fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .append(true).open("ledger.csv")?
        .write_all(line.as_bytes())?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Each change is one CSV line‚Äîsimple for demos, upgradeable to blockchain later.

## 7. Talk to HMS-CDF from Any Language

Calling CDF doesn‚Äôt require Rust; it exposes a tiny HTTP API.

```python
# advance_policy.py
import requests
resp = requests.post("http://cdf.local/dockets/42/advance")
print(resp.json())   # ‚Üí {'phase': 'Enactment'}
```

Under 10 lines and language-agnostic‚Äîperfect for micro-services in [Backend API Gateway](06_backend_api_gateway_.md).

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Tips

| Pitfall | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù fails with `Quorum not met` | Run `hms-cdf vote --yes 3 --no 0` to gather enough votes before advancing. |
| Amended text disappears | Amendments live in `dockets/42/amendments/`; merge them before advancing. |
| Circular references between policies | Use `hms-cdf link` only after both dockets reach Enactment to avoid loops. |

## 9. Recap & What‚Äôs Next

You learned how HMS-CDF:

‚Ä¢ Tracks a policy from **idea to law** with baked-in procedure checks.  
‚Ä¢ Provides a **finite-state machine** that is tiny yet auditable.  
‚Ä¢ Feeds higher layers like HMS-GOV and orchestration tools without giving up control.

Ready to see how the front-end teams plug multiple mini-apps (dashboard, vote panel, audit viewer) into one cohesive portal?
