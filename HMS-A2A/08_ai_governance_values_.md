# Chapter 8: AI Governance Values

In [Chapter 7: Policy/Process Module](07_policy_process_module_.md), you learned how workflows and policies get versioned and updated. Now let’s dive into the *values* that guide every AI decision—think of them as our system’s moral compass, constitution, and handbook all rolled into one.

## Why Governance Values Matter

Problem: If we let AI run unchecked, it can make unfair, biased, or even harmful decisions—just like a court without a constitution.  
Solution: Embed core principles—transparency, truth, safety, ethics, privacy—at every layer. This ensures our automated decisions are lawful, fair, and trusted by citizens.

**Example Use Case**  
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses an AI agent to recommend housing voucher allocations. We must ensure:

- A family’s personal data stays private (Privacy)  
- Every recommendation can be explained to a reviewer (Transparency)  
- The AI’s data sources are accurate and up to date (Truth)  
- No demographic group is unfairly disadvantaged (Ethics)  
- The system can’t be tricked into harmful behavior (Safety)  

## Key Governance Concepts

1. **Transparency**  
   – Audit logs, explainable results, clear rationale.  
   – Analogy: A court transcript showing every argument.

2. **Truth**  
   – Data validation, accuracy checks, source verification.  
   – Analogy: A fact-checker in journalism.

3. **Safety**  
   – Reject harmful inputs, enforce rate limits, guard rails.  
   – Analogy: Seat belts in a car.

4. **Ethics**  
   – Bias detection, fairness algorithms, inclusive rules.  
   – Analogy: A nondiscrimination clause in law.

5. **Privacy**  
   – Mask PII, enforce access controls, limit data retention.  
   – Analogy: A locked file cabinet for personal records.

## Applying Governance Values: A Simple Example

Imagine every request to our Finance Agent goes through a governance check before execution:

```javascript
import { governanceMiddleware } from 'hms-gov-service'
import { SpecializedAgent }      from 'hms-a2a-client'

// 1. Wrap your request in governance checks
app.post('/loan-checklist', governanceMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // 2. If we pass checks, call the finance agent
  const agent = SpecializedAgent.create('finance')
  const result = await agent.getChecklist(req.body)
  // 3. Log result for transparency
  req.governance.log('transparency', { request: req.body, result })
  res.json(result)
})

// Inside governanceMiddleware (simplified):
function governanceMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Audit the incoming data
  req.governance = {
    log: (value, info) => AuditSvc.record(value, info)
  }
  // Privacy: mask sensitive fields
  req.body = PrivacySvc.maskFields(req.body)
  // Ethics: reject unfair profiles
  if (!EthicsSvc.isFair(req.body)) {
    return res.status(403).send('Unfair request')
  }
  next()
}
```

Explanation:  
1. We mask personal data (Privacy).  
2. We check fairness (Ethics).  
3. We record an audit log (Transparency).  
4. If all checks pass, we execute the AI call.

## Under the Hood: Governance in Action

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Frontend
    participant Gov as GovernanceLayer
    participant Agent as A2A Service
    participant Audit as AuditService

    UI->>Gov: incoming request
    Gov->>Gov: privacy mask & ethics check
    Gov->>Agent: forward sanitized request
    Agent-->>Gov: returns result
    Gov->>Audit: log request & result
    Gov-->>UI: send result
```

1. **GovernanceLayer** masks and checks data.  
2. It calls the **A2A Service** (e.g., Finance Agent).  
3. It logs both request and response.  
4. Finally, the result goes back to the UI.

## Inside the Governance Layer

### governanceService.js (`hms-gov-service/src/services/governanceService.js`)

```javascript
class GovernanceService {
  // Check compliance for a given value
  async check(value, data) {
    // pretend: consult value rules (e.g., fairness thresholds)
    return true  // or false if violation
  }

  // Record an audit event
  async log(value, info) {
    // pretend: write to a durable audit store
  }
}

module.exports = new GovernanceService()
```

### Configuring Value Rules (`config/governanceValues.json`)

```json
{
  "transparency": { "logRequests": true },
  "privacy":      { "maskFields": ["ssn","birthDate"] },
  "ethics":       { "biasThreshold": 0.1 },
  "safety":       { "rateLimit": 100 },
  "truth":        { "dataSources": ["HUD_DB","Census_API"] }
}
```

Explanation:  
- Each value has its own settings—what to mask, how often to log, thresholds for bias, approved data sources, etc.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you learned how **AI Governance Values**—transparency, truth, safety, ethics, and privacy—act as our system’s foundation, ensuring every AI-driven recommendation is fair, legal, and trustworthy. These values are woven into middleware, agents, and audit logs across the entire HMS stack.
