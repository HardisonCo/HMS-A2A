They support sustainability, responsible sourcing, and regulatory compliance while adapting to market trends and environmental challenges.",
    "fullDescription": "Food systems manage the interplay between producers, processors, distributors, and consumers to provide safe, nutritious, and sustainable food. They address challenges such as climate change, supply chain disruptions, and population growth by adopting best practices in farming, processing, and distribution. Modern food systems incorporate advanced technologies like IoT sensors, blockchain traceability, and data analytics to reduce waste, enhance resource efficiency, and maintain safety standards (e.g., HACCP, ISO 22000). With growing consumer awareness of health and sustainability, these systems emphasize transparent sourcing, nutritional content, and eco-friendly practices. Collaboration among policymakers, industry leaders, and NGOs streamlines regulations and promotes equitable access to affordable, quality foodâ€”integral to public health and social equity.",
