    "fullDescription": "A robust energy sector underpins modern economies and is critical to social well-being. Energy systems involve multiple components—from power generation (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, fossil fuels) to transmission lines, distribution networks, and consumer-level management tools (smart meters, demand-response systems). Increasingly, energy strategies emphasize decarbonization and grid flexibility, leveraging advanced storage solutions, distributed generation, and AI-based load forecasting. Successful energy planning also balances affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship, ensuring equitable access and resilience against disruptions (e.g., natural disasters or cyberattacks).",
