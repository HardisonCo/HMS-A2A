  "description": "Tourism systems support travel experiences, destination management, and hospitality services by integrating digital booking platforms, visitor engagement solutions, and smart attraction management tools to enhance experiences and drive economic growth.",
  "fullDescription": "Tourism stimulates economic growth, cultural exchange, and heritage preservation, attracting travelers for leisure, business, or adventure. The industry spans accommodations, transport, attractions, and guided experiences. Digitalization via online travel agencies (OTAs), dynamic pricing, and user reviews has reshaped consumer choices and marketing strategies, while integrated finance modules track revenue and economic impact. Mass tourism can strain popular destinations, leading to overcrowding, environmental degradation, or cultural commodification. In response, sustainable tourism frameworks are being implemented to distribute visitor flows, protect ecosystems, and empower local communities. Post-pandemic recovery efforts are pivoting toward responsible, high-value travel that fosters resilience, invests in local supply chains, and adapts to climate change impacts on travel patterns.",
