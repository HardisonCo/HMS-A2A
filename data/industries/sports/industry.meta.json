    "fullDescription": "Sports encourage physical fitness, foster social cohesion, and often serve as a cornerstone of cultural identity. Elite competitions like the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup captivate global audiences, while grassroots programs encourage youth and community well-being. Modern sports management blends performance science, sports medicine, marketing, and digital engagement—through live broadcasts, esports, or interactive fan platforms. Hosting major events requires large-scale logistics, venue infrastructure, and security planning, with a growing push for sustainability (green stadiums, reduced carbon footprints). Anti-doping efforts, athlete welfare policies, and fair governance frameworks protect integrity and inclusivity in sport, ensuring competition remains a positive influence on society.",
