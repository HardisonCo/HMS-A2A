They leverage digital innovations, real-time analytics, and interoperability standards to improve population health outcomes and enhance decision-making.",
    "fullDescription": "Health systems protect and promote public well-being by delivering coordinated medical services and supporting preventive care initiatives. Modern health systems integrate electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, AI-driven diagnostics, and data analytics to streamline clinical workflows and facilitate evidence-based decision-making. They support the entire spectrum of care from acute treatment to long-term wellness programs, and emphasize patient safety, privacy, and efficiency. Collaborative efforts among healthcare providers, technology vendors, policymakers, and research institutions drive continuous improvements in care quality, accessibility, and cost management. These systems are crucial for managing chronic conditions, responding to epidemics, and ensuring that quality care is available to all segments of the population.",
