  "problemTitle": "The Global Energy Challenge",
  "problemSummary": "The world is in a race to make enough safe energy fast enough to meet the growing needs of an expanding and wealthier population. By 2050 another 2.5 billion people (1.7 billion population growth plus 760 million without electricity today) will need electricity, as will new demands from electrification of transportation, heating/cooling, AI, blockchain, and quantum computing.",
  "keyTrends": [
    "World energy demand is recovering from the impacts of the Covid recession and Russian invasion of the Ukraine",
    "Renewable energy capacity grew 50% more in 2023 than in 2022 worldwide (solar accounted for 75% of this growth)",
    "Electric vehicles are displacing about 1.5 million barrels of oil every day and potentially 5 million by 2030",
    "Solar is now the cheapest form of electricity in most countries and passing hydropower in total capacity",
    "By 2050 capacity will have to grow by 70% between 2020 and 2050 to accommodate population growth and economic development"

  "challengesAndOpportunities": {
    "fossilFuels": "Total fossil fuel consumption (oil, gas, and coal) is likely to continue increasing until the mid-2020s, when fossil fuel demand peaks and begins falling around an average of 2 exajoules per year to 2050.",
    "renewables": "Although renewable sources and energy efficiencies are expected to continue to increase, current trends make it unlikely that renewables will fully replace fossil fuels by 2050.",
    "nuclearPower": "Nuclear power produced less than 10% of the world's electricity in 2023, with 439 plants in 31 countries (including Taiwan). About 200 commercial reactors are scheduled to be shut down between 2020 and 2040.",
    "energyIntensiveIndustries": "Steel production accounts for 8% of global CO2 emissions, and its demand is projected to grow by 30% by 2050. The ICT industries consume somewhere between 5â€“9% of worldwide electricity consumption.",
    "innovations": "Interesting ideas in R&D include spray-on photovoltaics, metal air-breathing batteries, solar panel roads, AI to dramatically improve grid efficiency, solar farms focused heat on Stirling engines, high-altitude wind energy, and drilled hot rock enhanced geothermal systems."

  "actions": [
    "Commit to a U.S.-China Apollo-like 10-year energy goal with a NASA-like R&D system to achieve it that others can join",
    "Create an international R&D fund for investments in interesting ideas listed above",
    "Eliminate explicit and implicit subsidies for fossil fuels",
    "Periodically publicize country progress on UN Climate Change Agreements",
    "Work with International Renewable Energy Agency to harmonize regulations and standards for more predictable investment conditions",
    "Establish a globally accessible collective intelligence system for energy"

  "regional": {
    "AsiaAndOceania": "China is forecast to continue as the world leader in renewable energy with 43% growth over the next five years. Its export volume of PV products is expected to exceed $29 billion in the first half of 2023. By 2030 China expects to a third of its cars running on electricity.",
    "MiddleEastAndNorthAfrica": "Oil demand is decreasing while unconventional hydrocarbon production (e.g., shale gas, coalbed methane, and gas hydrates) is increasing as are solar and other renewable energy sources. The EU plans to import hydrogen from the region.",
    "SubSaharanAfrica": "Only half of Africa has access to electricity. McKinsey expects 1 billion more sub-Saharan Africans to gain access by 2040, which would still leave around 500 million without due to population growth.",
    "Europe": "Nearly 100% of new car sales in Norway are electric. Renewables grew 8.8% during 2022. Denmark, Germany, Belgium, and Netherlands plan offshore wind installed 150GW capacity.",
    "LatinAmerica": "A 2023 UNDP report outlined financial policies that could be implemented to help achieve the regions energy-environment goals. The region hosts major fossil fuel reserves as well as great capacity for renewable energy development.",
    "NorthAmerica": "The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides $370 billion in tax credits over a ten-year term for renewable energy projects and has attracted $100 billion in private sector investments during the first year."
