  "problemDescription": "The Covid pandemic increased awareness of the need to use global foresight as input to national and transnational strategy. Although our major challenges and actions to address them are global in nature, global foresight and global-scale decision-making systems are rarely employed. To change this, the UN Secretary-General proposed five strategies in 2021 in Our Common Agenda: UN Summit on the Future, a UN Futures Lab, periodic Strategic Foresight and Global Risk reports, an Envoy for Future Generations, and repurposed the UN Trusteeship Council as a multi-stakeholder foresight body.\n\nGovernance systems are not keeping up with growing global interdependence and socio-technological change. Since governments and large corporations have to make decisions taking into account global changes that are beyond their control, many are creating future strategy or foresight units to contribute to their strategic planning. OECD's Government Foresight Community is a collective improvement system for government foresight personnel.",

Foresight for Development makes research documents, projects, scenarios, futurists, and blogs available to support African futures research.
