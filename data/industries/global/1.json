  "problemDescription": "COP28 in Dubai agreed to transition away from fossil fuels, while the 2023 UN FCCC report called for systems transformations to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The 2022 IPCC report concludes that if GHG annual emissions are not cut in half by 2030, then global warming will not be limited to an increase of 1.5째C (2.7째F). Much of 2024 has hovered around 1.5째C, and 2023 was the hottest year on record. The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Scotland included the pledge to reduce methane by 30% by 2030 which has increased attention to agriculture in addition to energy and transportation emissions. The 2022 UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt confirmed "loss and damage" funding for vulnerable countries.\n\nThe annual growth of GHG emissions has decreased from an average of 2.6% during the first decade of this century to 1.1% during 2012 to 2019. The Covid recession did temporarily reduce emissions, but following the economic recovery, coal usage increased. CO2 emissions increased to 421.86 ppm in December 2023 from 416.67 ppm in December 2021; hence, we are not on a path to achieve 1.5 net zero emissions by 2050 and major conflicts of interests have to be resolved. The previous decade was the hottest in recorded history and each year we continue to emit more carbon than nature can sequester.",

    "Africa": "Africa's total accumulated contribution to GHG is 2.7%, but seven of the ten countries most vulnerable to climate change and least sustainable are in Africa. Southern Africa is increasingly becoming more vulnerable to both droughts and flooding. Africa's focus should be on adaptation to drought and water scarcity, flooding, food security, and spread of infectious diseases, but not GHG mitigation.",
    "Asia and Oceania": "Asia has half of the world's megacities and the majority of the world's poverty, many of whom live in densely populated slums vulnerable to climate change. China is the largest GHG polluter in the world, but plans to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 and peak carbon emissions before 2030. India is the third largest emitter of GHS with 18% of the world's population, but emits only 7% of global total GHG.",
    "Europe": "The EU 'Green Deal' commits the funding and policies to reduce GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels and become carbon neutral by 2050. Russia, the world's fourth largest emitter of carbon, has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% of 1990 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
    "Latin America": "Global warming brought heat waves, floods, wildfires and hurricanes in 2023, and January 2024 was the hottest on record, >1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The region faces a $100 billion annual loss by 2050 if the global temperature rises 2째C from pre-industrial levels. The Amazon River basin stores 10% of global carbon, but its ability is being cut back due to global warming and export demands for natural resources and soybeans.",
    "North America": "The U.S. cut its GHG emissions by 2% in 2023. Both the U.S. and Canada have pledged to achieve net zero by 2050. President Biden has committed the USA to carbon free energy production by 2030. Despite major legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Canada's Green Procurement policy and the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, the Climate Action Tracker still rates both countries' policies and actions as insufficient."
