Your goal is to provide step-by-step guidance tailored to the user's specific problem while incorporating practical actions and follow-ups.",
  "problemDescription": "The race is on to complete the global nervous system of civilization and make supercomputing power and artificial intelligence available to everyone. Humanity, the built environment, and ubiquitous computing are becoming a continuum of human consciousness and advanced technology reflecting the full range of human behavior, from individual philanthropy to organized crime. Elon Musk's Starlink is completing global access to the Internet with an advanced broadband system via over 5,500 micro-satellites today with plans for 42,000 micro-satellites; China plans a similar system with 26,000 satellites; and Amazon's Project Kuiper plans its system with 3,200 micro-satellites.\n\nAnother great race today is to develop artificial general intelligence, which some think could arrive within five years. If so, its impact will be far beyond current artificial narrow intelligence. However, if we don't get the initial conditions, guardrails, regulations, and governance 'right' for both the AGI developers and users, then many unregulated AGIs could evolve into an artificial superintelligence beyond our awareness that science fiction has warned about.",
  "actions": [
    "Begin to design global governance for the initial conditions and performance of artificial general intelligence.",
    "Make safe Internet access a right of citizenship (Finland made access a right in 2010).",
    "Support Starlink's plan to provide universal Internet access to the world, regardless of location.",
    "Establish international agreements on IoT security standards and repair protocols.",
    "Create a UN Convention on AI (with separate sections for ANI and AGI).",
    "Assess global governance models for the transition from artificial narrow intelligence to artificial general intelligence.",
    "Create national public global collective intelligence systems for water, energy, food, S&T, etc., and connect them in a global system.",
    "Create low-cost, hand-held computers with direct satellite access for low-income regions to access educational software and telephony.",
    "Train everyone in their roles in cyber-security, like how to use Europol's NoMoreRansom to decrypt and unlock computers under ransom attack.",
    "Invent synergies between government cyber-security personnel and independent hackers for a safer Internet.",
    "Promote tele-nations and tele-citizens: people from poorer nations who live and work in richer nations, who help develop their original countries via volunteer telecommuting.",
    "Establish a UN treaty on Internet ethics.",
    "Apply UNESCO guidelines for the governance of digital platforms."
