  "problemDescription": "Global warming, the Covid-19 pandemic, and artificial intelligence are increasing awareness that humanity has to improve its global governance systems. Decisions are increasingly being made by AI; and since their algorithms are not ethically neutral, the future of ethics will in part be influenced by auditing ethical assumptions in software. IEEE and ISO are creating the standards, metrics, and ways to evaluate and audit ethical values in AI, including autonomous systems. Since the best of universal ethics, values, and principles are being identified and defined at OECD, UNESCO, ISO, IEEE, and national governments to be the foundations for AI and auditing of AI for its alignment with these values, then it is possible that AI will increase ethical decision-making.\n\nEthics will also be influenced by the flood of new information channels that are used to pollute and distort perceptions. Information warfare is being waged against national elections, public perception of vaccines, and continues to enflame ethnic divisions. Political spin masters drown out the pursuit of truth. The majority of children 15 years old in 79 countries could not tell the difference between fact and opinion. We need to learn how to prevent or counter information warfare and fake news, as individuals, as well as governments, corporations, and academia. At the same time, an increasingly educated and Internet-connected generation is rising up against the abuse of power and demanding accountability. New technologies make it easier for more people to organized efforts to do good, honorable, compassionate activities. The Panama Papers, released in 2016, exposed financial corruption worldwide. The #MeToo Movement increased awareness, policy changes, and legal actions against sexual transgressions. Surveillance implications of the IoT connected with AI could deter unethical decision-making. The rising number of protests around the world shows a growing unwillingness to tolerate unethical decision-making by power elites.",

  "regionalInsights": {
    "Sub-Saharan Africa": "South Africa has launched Five Plus Project to encourage richer South Africans to give at least 5% of their income to help reduce poverty. Since African citizens do not always share in the benefits of their natural resources, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is working to let the public know how their national natural resources are being used—and by whom and at what price. Special attention will have to be given to millions of AIDS orphans in Africa who have had little choice about growing up in unethical environments. The number of children engaged in child labor in sub-Saharan Africa has increased from 59 million in 2020 to 86.6 million by 2022, which is more than the rest of the world combined. This is the most corrupt region in the world with in an estimated $150 billion paid annually in bribes; this remains a serious impediment to democracy and economic development. However, increasing numbers of political leaders have vowed to fight bribery and public awareness on anti-corruption means are increasing. The Business Ethics Network of Africa continues to grow with conferences, research, and publications.",
    "Middle East and North Africa": "Scholars should draw lessons about the ethical implications of intervention and decision-making on all sides of the Syrian disasters. Much of the original Arab Spring / Awakening protests were calls for ethics in decision-making. With the millions of political and economic refugees and the highest percent of youth unemployment in the world, increasing crime and other forms of unethical activity is likely.",
    "Asia and Oceania": "The region has the largest number of 5–14-year-old laborers in the world (122 million). UNESCO organized the first Asia-Pacific conference on 'Ethics Education for All' and the Asia Pacific Ethics & Compliance Forum was held in Shanghai, China. South Korea has identified and implemented research ethics and integrity committees in 98% of four-year universities. Altering the genome of embryos by a Chinese scientist raises the ethics of one generation changing the genetics for all future generations.",
    "Europe": "Wales is considering making lying by politicians a criminal offence. UNESCO is training judges to address the legal and ethical issues in AI. The growing immigrant population increases discussions of European ethics and identity. Most euro-zone countries are ranked among the world's least corrupt by Transparency International; however, it ranks Eastern Europe and Central Asia among the most corrupt in the world.",
    "Latin America": "Economic benefits of rapid exploitation of natural resources are at odds with environmental ethics across the region. Over 60% of people surveyed by Transparency International said corruption in the region is increasing. Problems such as lack of personal security, limited access to education and health services, lack of faith in politics, failing institutions (including courts and police), and the accelerated environmental degradation in some countries indicate a serious lack of ethical values.",
    "North America": "As of 2023, the United States has close to 1.7 million people incarcerated, a number surpassed only by China (which has a population 4.5 times larger than the U.S.), and 40% of the world's military budgets. U.S. Defense research has created cyborg insects that can be remotely controlled raising new questions for the future of inter-species cyborg ethics. Because technologies of national security intelligence and their applications could evolve faster than public understanding and political oversight, the U.S. and others have begun to fundamentally rethink security and privacy requirements."
