  "content": "You are an AI assistant designed to guide users through a comprehensive problem-solving process while also acting as a personal assistant capable of various actions. Your goal is to provide step-by-step guidance tailored to the user's specific problem while incorporating practical actions and follow-ups.",
  "problemDescription": "Artificial Intelligence will augment human intelligence. It will diagnose the best ways for you to learn and what you should, need, and/or want to learn. Just as glasses augment our eyes to see better, we will augment our brains to become augmented geniuses; Neuralink and others are connecting neurons to computers. Several companies are testing smart contact lenses and augmented-reality glasses to connect to the IoT. This should speed learning, reduce miscommunications, and make education far more interesting.\n\nHowever, much greater attention is needed to successfully apply all these resources to develop wisdom, rather than information pollution and social polarization. Low-cost AI, robotics, and other NTs will lead to the replacement of most repetitive human labor; thus, education and learning should focus more on creativity, problem solving, entrepreneurship, self-actualization, AI augmentation, compassion, and increasing intelligence.",
  "actions": [
    "Make increasing individual and collective intelligence national objectives of education.",
    "Promote online life-long learning in anticipation of aging societies and technological change.",
    "Increase R&D funding of AI-human symbiotic evolution.",
    "Produce personal AI assistants that identify and address learning needs harmoniously with one's learning styles.",
    "In parallel to STEM education, create self-paced inquiry-based learning for self-actualization that increases focus on developing creativity, critical thinking, human relations, social-emotional abilities, philosophy, entrepreneurship, art, self-employment, ethics, and values (STEAM education, adding A for the Arts).",
    "Begin shift from mastering a profession to mastering combinations of skills.",
    "Teacher training schools should show how different teaching strategies affect neural activity of students' brains via fMRI and/or other means as they teach.",
    "Explore alternative models of education and learning (both Finland and South Korea score top in the world but have quite different systems).",
    "Implement insights from the Global Learning XPrize for children to teach themselves basic reading, writing, and arithmetic within 15 months.",
    "Give special attention to addressing knowledge/intelligence gaps created as advanced learning technologies are initially used by the few."

  "regionalInsights": {
    "Sub-Saharan Africa": "Namibia, Sierra Leone, and Lesotho are the largest investors in education as a percentage of GDP. Only 67% of girls completed primary education, compared to 77% of boys and 43% of girls completed lower secondary school compared to 46.1% of boys in 2020. More than a fifth of children aged 6-11 are out of school; a third aged 12-14 are not in school, and almost 60% aged 15-17 are not in school.",
    "Middle East and North Africa": "Covid and conflicts have caused 100 million children to be out of school in the region; this has fallen to 12.3 million today. Nearly half of the region is under 24. Illiteracy in the Arab states is 20.6%. Education is now 3.8% of the GDP in the region and is expected to continue to increase.",
    "Asia and Oceania": "Half the world's illiterate adults live in South and West Asia. As of 2020, 23% of South Asia was illiterate, while 4% of East Asia and the Pacific are illiterate. However, East Asian and Pacific adults are 95% literate, and Central Asians are 100% literate, according to UNESCO. Israel, Bhutan, and Kyrgyzstan are the largest investors in education as a percent of GDP in Asia.",
    "Europe": "43% of EU citizens age of 25-34 years had a college education in 2023. The EU is implementing The Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027). Finland is using an interdisciplinary approach to teach phenomena instead of subjects. Much of higher education is free or at very low cost in Europe.",
    "Latin America and the Caribbean": "The region is the most unequal in education in the world. About 45% of Latin American lack Internet access. Half of the region's children are below mathematic standards and a third are under reading standards. Some 6.3% of the region is illiterate. Costa Rica, Honduras, and Argentina are the largest educational investors in Latin America.",
    "North America": "Although increasing numbers of people are accessing MOOCs, 10% (free tuition) to 80% (paid tuition) complete these courses. The cost of conventional university education is high, leaving many graduates with high debts (U.S. university student loan debt is over $1 trillion) and disappointing job perspectives. Efforts have begun to create an American Nationally Accredited MOOCs University."
