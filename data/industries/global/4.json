  "problemDescription": "The long-term growth of democratization has declined for the past 18 years. Net declines in indicators of democracy outnumbered net advances for the sixth consecutive year. The percentage of the world population governed by autocracies authoritarian regimes has increased from 49% in 2011 to about 70% in 2023. Both Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders document decreasing press freedoms, as polarization has increased. The internet has become a new battleground for information warfare with millions of fake bots spreading individually targeted disinformation turning 'I don't like, to I hate,' and then to 'they are the enemy.' The UN Secretary-General is creating a framework for safe AI including methods to counter disinformation. Leading AI corporations and governments are also seeking counters to disinformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to a decline in freedom. At the same time, new Internet capabilities provide more access for greater participation in governance and are increasingly exposing corruption. Synergistically self-organized human rights movements for sustainable global democratic systems are taking place all over the world.",

  "regionalInsights": {
    "Sub-Saharan Africa": "The economic and social impacts of Covid have made some sub-Saharan African countries vulnerable to military coups, democratic backsliding and an increase in authoritarian leadership. Freedom House reported that nearly 14% of sub-Saharan Africa is rated 'free,' 31% rated 'partly free,' while 55% are 'not free' status as of 2023. No country in the region was rated as having free media, and only 5 countries were rated as 'satisfactory' freedom of the press.",
    "Middle East and North Africa": "Five countries in the region are classified as either free or partly free: Kuwait, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia, while 93% of the region still live in societies rated as not free. Yemen and Syria are among the top ten failed states. The Arab Spring has yet to produce a more democratic region. The majority of the world's most dangerous places for journalists are located in the Middle East and North Africa Region.",
    "Asia and Oceania": "The region's population rated as free fell from 38% in 2017 to 5% in 2022. However, Freedom House found that eight countries improved in their political rights and civil liberties in 2022, while six declined, and the population in 'not free' countries declined by 15%. Most countries in this region are characterized by the Democracy Index 2022 as a mixture of flawed democracies, and hybrid and authoritarian regimes.",
    "Europe": "Most of Europe is rated as free except Abkhazia, Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, and Ukraine rated as partly free, and Azerbaijan and Russia as not free. The EU Parliament is the largest transnational democratic electorate in the world and political and fiscal integration helped the growth of democracy across Europe.",
    "Latin America": "Rampant corruption, organized crime, and institutional weakness in addressing the social and political demands of people are the key impediments to democracy in the region. Freedom House ranked most of Latin America and the Caribbean countries as free or partly free with only Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela as not free.",
    "North America": "The Biden administration has held two Summits for Democracy with over 70 governments who have committed to actions in the Summit for Democracy Declaration. Voter turnout in the U.S. improved from 54.8% in 2016 to 66.8% in 2020. Strategies to reduce the role of money in politics, like limits on contributions and Political Action Committees have not succeeded. Increased partisan polarization leaves two-thirds of 18- to 29-year-olds polled depressed about the future of democracy in the U.S."
