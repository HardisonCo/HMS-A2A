Example 1: The SPS weights sum to 1.0
This is a simple numerical identity that can be easily proven.
-/
theorem sps_weights_sum_to_one : 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1 :=
begin
  norm_num,  -- Simple numerical computation
end

Example 2: For any weights that sum to 1 and impacts bounded by 100,
the maximum WAR score is 100 when all impacts are at their maximum.

theorem max_war_score_example {n : Nat} (weights : Fin n → ℝ) (drps : Fin n → ℝ)
  (h1 : ∀ (i : Fin n), weights i > 0)
  (h2 : ∑ i, weights i = 1) 
  (h3 : ∀ (i : Fin n), drps i = 1) :  -- Simplification: all DRPs are 1
  warScore weights (λ i, 100) drps = 100 :=

Example 3: Conservative deficit reduction with a specific margin of safety.
Shows that using a margin of safety of 0.8 makes the DRP estimate more conservative.

  (h1 : baselineDeficit > 0)
  (h2 : policyEffect > 0) :
  let buffettMargin := 0.8
  let rawReduction := policyEffect
  baselineDeficit - rawReduction * buffettMargin > baselineDeficit - rawReduction :=

Example 4: Demonstrate that a simple SPS calculation with equal factors is bounded by those factors.
-/
theorem sps_with_equal_factors (factor : ℝ)
  (h1 : 0 ≤ factor ∧ factor ≤ 100) :
  sectorPrioritizationScore factor factor factor factor = factor :=

Example 5: Show that financial stability score is 1 when there are no risks.

Example 6: Market equilibrium with simple linear supply and demand functions.
