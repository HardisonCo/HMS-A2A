## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| EHR system interface changes | High | Medium | Build adapter layer, version APIs, monitor for changes |
| Regulatory compliance issues | High | Medium | Regular reviews with compliance experts, maintain audit logs |
| Performance bottlenecks in genetic engine | Medium | High | Implement optimization techniques, profile early, plan for scaling |
| Data privacy breaches | High | Low | Implement strict access controls, encrypt sensitive data, regular security audits |
| Integration issues between components | Medium | Medium | Define clear interfaces, comprehensive integration testing, versioned APIs |

## Open Issues

1. **Performance optimization for genetic algorithms**
   - Need to evaluate parallel processing options
   - Consider GPU acceleration for fitness calculations
   - Requires benchmarking with larger datasets

2. **FHIR version compatibility**
   - Currently supporting FHIR R4, need to evaluate FHIR R5 support
   - Some EHR systems still use older FHIR versions
   - Need adapter strategy for version differences

3. **HMS-UHC integration planning**
   - Need to finalize integration approach with HMS-UHC
   - Insurance eligibility verification requirements unclear
   - Prior authorization workflows need specification
