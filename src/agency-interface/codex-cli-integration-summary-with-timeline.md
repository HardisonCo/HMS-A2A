2. **Modularity**: Maintain clear separation of concerns
3. **Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
4. **Testability**: Implement comprehensive tests for all components
5. **Documentation**: Provide detailed API and usage documentation

## Resource Requirements

1. **Development Resources**
   - 2-3 TypeScript developers
   - 1 QA engineer
   - 1 technical writer

2. **Testing Resources**
