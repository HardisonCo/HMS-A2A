# agency-interface â€“ Communication Plan

## 1. Title & Purpose
This communication plan outlines how the Agency Interface team coordinates with internal stakeholders, agency representatives, and Codex CLI users throughout the implementation and operational lifecycle of the system. It establishes clear channels, stakeholder roles, and protocols for agency-specific feature deployment and issue resolution.

## 2. Communication Channels & Protocols

### Primary Communication Channels
- **Slack Channels:**
  - `#agency-interface-dev`: Development coordination and technical discussions
  - `#agency-interface-announcements`: Official announcements and release notes
  - `#agency-interface-support`: User support and troubleshooting
  - Agency-specific channels (e.g., `#agency-aphis`, `#agency-hhs`)

### Regular Meetings
- **Weekly Development Sync**: Mondays at 10:00 AM ET
  - Development team status updates
  - Technical issue resolution
  - Sprint planning and review
  
- **Bi-weekly Stakeholder Update**: Every other Thursday at 2:00 PM ET
  - Implementation progress updates
  - Feature demonstrations
  - Feedback collection
  
- **Monthly Agency Coordination**: First Tuesday of each month at 11:00 AM ET
  - Agency representatives and domain experts
  - Feature prioritization
  - Domain-specific requirements

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation Repository**: `/docs/agency-interface` in the main repository
- **Implementation Wiki**: Up-to-date agency status dashboard
- **Knowledge Base**: Troubleshooting guides and best practices
- **Implementation Tracking Dashboard**: Real-time status visualization

### Notification Protocols

**DevOps Team** | Infrastructure Team | Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring | Bi-weekly (deployment planning)
**Documentation Team** | Technical Writers | User guides, API documentation | Monthly (doc planning)

## 4. Incident Escalation & Cut-Over Plans

### Incident Severity Levels
- **Level 1 (Critical)**: System-wide outage, all agencies affected
- **Level 2 (Major)**: Multiple agencies affected, significant functionality impacted
- **Level 3 (Moderate)**: Single agency affected, or non-critical functionality impacted
- **Level 4 (Minor)**: Cosmetic issues, minor bugs, no significant impact

### Escalation Path
1. **Initial Response**: Development team member acknowledges issue in `#agency-interface-support`
2. **Level 1-2 Escalation**: Technical Lead and DevOps notified immediately
3. **Level 3 Escalation**: Technical Lead notified, addressed in next daily standup
4. **Level 4 Escalation**: Logged as issue, prioritized in next sprint planning

### Response Time Targets
- Level 1: 15 minutes acknowledgment, 1 hour resolution plan
- Level 2: 30 minutes acknowledgment, 4 hour resolution plan
- Level 3: 4 hour acknowledgment, 24 hour resolution plan
- Level 4: 24 hour acknowledgment, prioritized in next sprint

### Cut-Over Strategy for Major Releases
- **Pre-Release Testing**: Complete UAT with agency representatives
- **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to Tier 1 agencies first, then expand
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Deploy with feature flags, ability to revert
- **Dual-Run Period**: Legacy and new systems operated in parallel during transition
- **Go/No-Go Decision Meeting**: Final review before full cutover
- **Post-Cutover Monitoring**: Intensive monitoring for first 48 hours

## 5. Integration with Master Communication Plan

The Agency Interface communication plan aligns with the Master Codify Communications Framework in the following ways:

- **Wave-Based Implementation**: Part of "Wave 2" in the master plan
- **Cross-Component Coordination**: 
  - Bi-weekly cross-component sync meetings
  - Shared status reporting in the master dashboard
  - Coordinated release planning with dependent components
- **Unified Knowledge Management**:
  - Documentation integrated with central knowledge base
  - Shared glossary of terms and concepts
  - Cross-referenced implementation plans
- **Escalation Harmony**:
  - Follows master incident management framework
  - Uses shared on-call rotation
  - Integrated status reporting
- **Release Synchronization**:
  - Releases aligned with master release calendar
  - Feature dependencies tracked in master plan
  - Backward compatibility requirements defined in master plan
