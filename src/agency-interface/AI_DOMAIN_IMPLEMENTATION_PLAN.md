- **agriculture**: AI for crop protection, animal health, and inspection
- **safety**: AI for product safety, risk assessment, and recall prediction
- **environment**: AI for environmental monitoring and safety
- **finance**: AI for financial risk assessment and fraud detection
- **nutrition**: AI for nutrition analysis and policy modeling
- **food**: AI for food safety and quality control
- **transportation**: AI for crash prevention and vehicle safety
- **drugs**: AI for drug reviews and pharmacovigilance
- **biologics**: AI for biologics evaluation and manufacturing oversight
- **complementary_health**: AI for complementary health research

### 4.3 Domain-Specific Components

Each domain will have specialized components:

1. **Domains**: Specific areas of application within the domain
2. **Frameworks**: Regulatory and implementation frameworks
3. **AI Capabilities**: Specific AI capabilities for the domain
4. **Validation Framework**: Domain-specific model validation

### 4.4 Configuration Structure

The configuration will follow this structure:

```json
{
  "acronym": "AGENCY",
  "name": "Agency Full Name",
  "domain": "domain_type",
  "ai_enabled": true,
  "implementation_status": {
    "overall_completion": 75,
    "current_phase": "Phase 2",
    "next_milestone": "Knowledge Base Integration"
  }
}
```

### 4.5 Knowledge Base Integration

Each domain will have specialized knowledge integrated:

1. **Domain Ontology**: Concepts and relationships within the domain
2. **AI Models**: Specific AI model types and applications
3. **Regulatory Framework**: Domain-specific regulations
4. **Validation Requirements**: Model validation criteria

## 5. Codex CLI Integration

### 5.1 New Commands

The Codex CLI will be extended with AI-specific commands:

```bash
# View AI domain information
codex hms ai info [agency]

# List AI models for domain
codex hms ai models [agency]

# Check AI model validation status
codex hms ai validate [agency] [model]

# Generate AI implementation report
codex hms ai report [agency]
```

### 5.2 Agency Context

When working with an AI agency, Codex will provide specialized context:
