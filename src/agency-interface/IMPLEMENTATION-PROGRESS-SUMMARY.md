# HMS-API to Crohn's Adaptive Trials Integration: Implementation Progress Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the implementation progress for the HMS-API to Crohn's Adaptive Trials Integration project. The project aims to integrate HMS-API Programs and Protocols into the core system for managing Crohn's disease adaptive clinical trials via HMS-GOV, with support for protocol verification, genetic optimization, and protocol adaptation.

## Project Phases

The project is organized into four main phases:

2. **Core Integration** (Weeks 5-8): Implementing cross-component communication and integration
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 9-12): Adding protocol adaptation, treatment optimization, and enhanced verification
4. **Finalization** (Weeks 13-16): Comprehensive testing, optimization, security, and documentation

## Current Progress
