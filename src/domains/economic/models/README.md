# Economic Foundations in Lean 4

This directory contains the foundational economic axioms and theorems for use with the DeepSeek-Prover-V2 integration in the HMS system.

## Overview

This Lean 4 library provides formal specifications of economic theorems, particularly focused on:

- Utility theory and preference relations
- Market equilibrium analysis
- The Moneyball-Buffett approach to economic policy analysis
- Financial stability metrics
- Unified economic models

## Structure

- `EconomicFoundations/Basic.lean`: Core economic definitions and axioms
- `EconomicFoundations/MoneyballTheorems.lean`: Theorems related to the Moneyball-Buffett approach
- `EconomicFoundations/UtilityTheory.lean`: Utility theory foundations and related theorems
- `EconomicFoundations/MarketEquilibrium.lean`: Market equilibrium theory and price discovery
- `EconomicFoundations/DeepSeekExamples.lean`: Example theorems for testing DeepSeek-Prover-V2

## Using with DeepSeek-Prover-V2

These Lean 4 files are designed to work with the DeepSeek-Prover-V2 integration. Most theorems include `sorry` placeholders that DeepSeek-Prover-V2 will attempt to complete with formal proofs.

## Example Workflow

1. Define economic axioms and theorems in Lean 4 format
2. Use the DeepSeek-Prover-V2 client to process these definitions:

```python
from HMS.A2A.genetic_theorem_prover.core.deepseek_prover import DeepSeekProverClient, ProverRequest, ProverConfig, ProverMode

# Initialize the DeepSeek-Prover-V2 client
client = DeepSeekProverClient(ProverConfig(
    mode=ProverMode.DEFAULT,
    api_url="https://api.example.com/deepseek-prover",
    api_key="your-api-key"
))

# Prove a theorem
request = ProverRequest(
    theorem_id="war_score_bounded",
    formal_expression="-100 ≤ warScore weights impacts drps ∧ warScore weights impacts drps ≤ 100",
    assumptions=[
        "∀ (i : Fin n), weights i > 0",
        "(∑ i, weights i) = 1",
        "∀ (i : Fin n), -100 ≤ impacts i ∧ impacts i ≤ 100",
        "∀ (i : Fin n), drps i ≥ 0"
    ],
    variables={
        "weights": "Fin n → ℝ",
        "impacts": "Fin n → ℝ",
        "drps": "Fin n → ℝ",
        "n": "Nat"
    },
    config=ProverConfig(mode=ProverMode.COT)  # Use Chain of Thought mode
)

response = client.prove_theorem(request)
print(f"Proof successful: {response.success}")
if response.success:
    print(f"Proof steps: {len(response.proof_steps)}")
    print(response.proof)
```

## Integration with HMS

These foundation files integrate with the HMS system through the HMS-A2A component, specifically:

- `HMS-A2A/genetic_theorem_prover/core/deepseek_prover.py` - Client for interacting with DeepSeek-Prover-V2
- `HMS-A2A/formal_verification_framework.py` - Framework for verifying economic models

## Adding New Theorems

To add new economic theorems:

1. Add the theorem declaration to the appropriate file with a `sorry` proof placeholder
2. Create corresponding entries in the verification framework
3. Use the genetic theorem prover to evolve proof strategies
