# Adaptive Surveillance and Response System - Foundation

This directory contains the foundational components of the Adaptive Surveillance and Response System (ASRS) architecture that will be used across all agency implementations. These components provide the core capabilities while allowing for agency-specific extensions.

## Directory Structure

- `/base_models/` - Core domain models that can be extended for agency-specific requirements
- `/core_services/` - Reusable services for sampling, detection, prediction, and visualization
- `/api_framework/` - Standardized API components for consistent interfaces
- `/extension_points/` - Interfaces for agency-specific extensions
- `/utilities/` - Common utilities and helper functions
- `/federation/` - Components for cross-agency data sharing and integration

## Implementation Principles

1. **Consistency with Variation**: All implementations use the same core architecture but allow for agency-specific adaptations
2. **Extension over Modification**: Extend the base components rather than modifying them
3. **Standardized APIs**: Consistent API interfaces across all implementations
4. **Clear Extension Points**: Well-defined interfaces for agency-specific extensions
5. **Shared Capabilities**: Core capabilities are implemented once and reused
6. **Documented Patterns**: All implementation patterns are documented for reference

## Getting Started

To create a new agency implementation:

1. Start with the template in `/templates/new_agency_implementation/`
2. Customize the domain models for agency requirements
3. Implement agency-specific detection algorithms
4. Create specialized visualization components
5. Add agency-specific regulatory frameworks
6. Integrate with existing agency systems

## Core Capabilities

All agency implementations will include these core capabilities:

1. **Adaptive Sampling**: Optimize resource allocation using response-adaptive strategies
2. **Statistical Outbreak Detection**: Implement group sequential and spatial cluster detection
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast spread using ensemble approaches
4. **Genetic Analysis**: Analyze genomic data to understand changes and patterns
5. **Transmission Analysis**: Reconstruct networks and identify patterns
6. **Notification System**: Multi-channel alerts with role-based content
7. **Visualization Services**: Maps, charts, and comprehensive dashboards

## Reference Implementation

The APHIS Bird Flu Tracking System serves as the reference implementation for the architecture. See `/implementations/usda_aphis/` for details.
