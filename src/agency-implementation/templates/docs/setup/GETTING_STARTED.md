# Getting Started with Agency Implementation

This guide walks through the process of setting up a new agency implementation using these templates.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the HMS system codebase
- Understanding of the HMS architecture and component interaction
- Familiarity with the agency's specific requirements and processes

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new directory for your agency implementation:
   ```bash
   cp -r templates/ HMS-[AGENCY-CODE]
   cd HMS-[AGENCY-CODE]
   ```

2. Update the agency metadata in `config/agency.json` with your agency's details

3. Initialize a new git repository (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial agency implementation from template"
   ```

## Customization Steps

1. **Define Agency-Specific Models**
   - Modify the model templates in `src/models/` to match your agency's data structures
   - Add any additional models required by your agency

2. **Implement Business Logic**
   - Customize the service templates in `src/services/` to implement your agency's business logic
   - Add any additional services needed for your agency's specific workflows

3. **Configure API Endpoints**
   - Adjust the API endpoint templates in `src/api/` to expose your agency's functionality
   - Ensure all endpoints follow HMS API standards and security requirements

4. **Set Up Integrations**
   - Configure the integration templates in `src/integrations/` to connect with other HMS components
   - Implement any agency-specific integration points

5. **Customize Configuration**
   - Update all configuration files in the `config/` directory with agency-specific settings

## Testing Your Implementation

1. Update the test templates in the `tests/` directory to test your agency-specific implementations

2. Run the tests to verify your implementation:
   ```bash
   # Command to run tests will depend on your implementation language/framework
   ```

## Documentation

1. Update the documentation templates in the `docs/` directory to reflect your agency-specific implementation

2. Ensure you document:
   - Agency-specific features and functionality
   - Custom workflows and processes
   - Integration points with other HMS components
   - Any special configuration requirements

## Integration with HMS

Follow the instructions in `docs/integration/HMS_INTEGRATION.md` to integrate your agency implementation with the broader HMS system.
