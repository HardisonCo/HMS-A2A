# Agency Implementation Framework

A standardized framework for implementing Agency-specific systems within the HMS ecosystem. This framework provides core services, extension mechanisms, and reference implementations for rapid development of compliant, interoperable agency systems.

## Overview

The Agency Implementation Framework enables government agencies to build specialized, domain-specific systems while maintaining interoperability and compliance with core HMS architectural principles. The framework emphasizes:

- **Standardized Architecture**: Common patterns and interfaces across all implementations
- **Flexible Extension Points**: Well-defined customization interfaces for agency-specific needs
- **Comprehensive Foundation Services**: Reusable core services that implement common capabilities
- **Federation Capabilities**: Built-in interoperability for cross-agency data sharing
- **Security and Compliance**: Integrated security controls and compliance mechanisms
- **Reference Implementations**: Working examples of agency-specific implementations

## Core Components

### Foundation Layer

The [foundation layer](foundation/README.md) provides the core building blocks:

- **Core Services**: Adaptive sampling, detection, prediction, notification, visualization
- **Base Models**: Extensible domain models to be customized per agency
- **API Framework**: Standardized API construction patterns
- **Extension Points**: Interfaces for agency-specific customizations
- **Federation Components**: Cross-agency data sharing mechanisms
- **Utilities**: Common functionality for logging, configuration, error handling

### Extension Mechanisms

The framework uses several mechanisms for customization:

1. **Extension Points**: Defined interfaces for adding agency-specific implementations
2. **Customization Hooks**: Integration points to modify behavior without changing core code
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic loading of agency-specific components
4. **Configuration-Based Adaptation**: Extensive configuration options to modify system behavior

### Implementation Templates

Ready-to-use templates provide starting points for new agency implementations:

- **Project Structure**: Standardized directory layout for consistent organization
- **Configuration Templates**: Pre-configured files for various deployment scenarios
- **API Templates**: Starter API controllers with documentation
- **Integration Templates**: Patterns for connecting with HMS and external systems
- **Documentation Templates**: Standardized formats for agency-specific documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ and/or Rust 1.54+
- Git
- Access to HMS Component Registry

### Quick Start

1. **Create a new agency implementation** using the template:

```bash
# Clone the template to create a new agency implementation
cp -r templates/ my-agency-implementation
cd my-agency-implementation

# Initialize the project with your agency code
./initialize_project.sh MY_AGENCY_CODE
```

2. **Configure the implementation** for your agency:

```bash
# Edit the agency configuration file
nano config/agency.json

# Update environment settings
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

3. **Start the development environment**:

```bash
# Build and start the development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Access the development API**:
   - API endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api
   - API documentation: http://localhost:5000/docs
   - Health check: http://localhost:5000/health

For detailed setup instructions, see [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started/README.md).

## Example Implementations

The framework includes several reference implementations that demonstrate how to adapt the framework for specific agency requirements:

| Agency | Description | Focus Areas |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [CDC](implementations/cdc/) | Disease surveillance system | Outbreak detection, contact tracing |
| [FEMA](implementations/fema/) | Emergency response coordination | Disaster response, resource allocation |
| [EPA](implementations/epa/) | Environmental monitoring system | Pollutant tracking, compliance monitoring |

Each implementation demonstrates agency-specific customizations while maintaining compatibility with the core HMS architecture.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:

## Key Features

### Adaptive Sampling

The framework includes sophisticated adaptive sampling strategies that optimize resource allocation based on evolving conditions, ensuring efficient use of limited resources and maximizing detection capabilities.

### Statistical Detection

Built-in statistical methods for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and trend analysis enable early identification of emerging issues and events requiring agency attention.

### Genetic Analysis Integration

Specialized genetic analysis capabilities allow agencies to incorporate genomic data for advanced tracking, pattern detection, and variant monitoring across different domains.

### Cross-Agency Federation

The federation layer enables secure, standardized data sharing between agencies while maintaining appropriate access controls and data governance requirements.

### Visualization Components

Comprehensive visualization capabilities transform complex data into actionable insights through interactive maps, dashboards, charts, and reports customized for various stakeholders.

## Deployment Options

The framework supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Development**: Local Docker-based environment for rapid development
- **Testing**: Isolated testing environment with mock dependencies
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment with integration points
- **Production**: High-availability configuration for operational use

Deployment configurations are provided for:
