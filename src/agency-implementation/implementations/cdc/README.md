# CDC Implementation

This implementation adapts the agency foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), focusing on disease surveillance, outbreak detection, and public health response capabilities.

## Key Features

- Disease outbreak detection and monitoring
- Genetic sequence analysis for pathogen identification
- Contact tracing and transmission modeling
- Public health data visualization and reporting
- Integration with state health departments
- Alert system for public health emergencies

## Components

- **Disease Surveillance System**: Real-time monitoring of disease occurrence
- **Genomic Analysis Engine**: Analysis of pathogen genetic sequences
- **Epidemiological Modeling**: Predictive modeling for disease spread
- **Public Health Dashboard**: Visualization of public health data
- **Alert Distribution System**: Notifications for health emergencies

## Integration Points

- State health department data feeds
- Clinical laboratory reporting systems
- World Health Organization (WHO) global surveillance
- Healthcare facility capacity monitoring
- Vaccine distribution tracking
