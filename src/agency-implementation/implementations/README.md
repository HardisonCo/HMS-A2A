# Agency Implementations

This directory contains example implementations of the agency foundation for three different federal agencies, each adapted to their specific domain requirements and use cases.

## Overview

Each implementation demonstrates how the core foundation can be customized for different agency domains while maintaining a consistent architecture and approach. The implementations include:

1. **CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)** - Focused on disease surveillance, outbreak detection, and public health response
2. **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)** - Focused on environmental monitoring, pollution detection, and regulatory compliance
3. **FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)** - Focused on disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation

## Implementation Structure

Each agency implementation follows the same structure:

```

│   └── agency.json         # Agency-specific configuration

└── tests/                  # Agency-specific tests
```

## Common Foundation Components

All implementations extend and customize the foundation components:

- **Core Services** - Base services adapted to agency-specific needs
- **Extension Points** - Agency-specific implementations of extension interfaces
- **API Framework** - Consistent API approach across implementations
- **Federation Framework** - Inter-agency data sharing capabilities

## Key Differences Between Implementations

### CDC Implementation

- **Domain Models**: Disease and outbreak models
- **Key Services**: Disease surveillance, genomic analysis, epidemiological modeling
- **Data Sources**: Clinical labs, state health departments, WHO surveillance
- **Integration Focus**: Health Alert Network, vaccination systems

### EPA Implementation

- **Domain Models**: Pollutant and environmental event models
- **Key Services**: Environmental monitoring, pollution detection, compliance management
- **Data Sources**: Monitoring stations, satellite imagery, emissions reports
- **Integration Focus**: State environmental agencies, weather services

### FEMA Implementation

- **Domain Models**: Disaster and emergency response models
- **Key Services**: Emergency response coordination, resource management, damage assessment
- **Data Sources**: Weather services, USGS, satellite imagery, field reports
- **Integration Focus**: State emergency agencies, IPAWS alert system

## Customization Patterns

Each implementation demonstrates several common patterns for agency-specific customization:

1. **Domain Model Extension** - Agency-specific models tailored to domain requirements
2. **Service Specialization** - Core services extended with domain-specific functionality
3. **Data Source Integration** - Custom data source implementations for agency data sources
4. **Alert Channel Configuration** - Notification channels adapted to agency communication needs
5. **Visualization Components** - Specialized visualization components for domain data

## Getting Started

To work with these example implementations:

1. Choose the implementation that most closely matches your agency's domain
2. Review the configuration in `config/agency.json` to understand options
3. Explore the domain models in `src/models/` to see how to represent your data
4. Review the services in `src/services/` to understand domain-specific functionality
5. See the customization guide in `docs/customization/` for extension guidance

## Implementation Notes

- These examples demonstrate the key architectural patterns but are not complete implementations
- In a real implementation, you would add more comprehensive test coverage
- Additional documentation would be needed for production deployments
- Security configurations would need to be enhanced for actual agency use
