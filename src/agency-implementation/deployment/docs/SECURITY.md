# Agency Implementation System Security Guide

This document outlines security considerations, best practices, and configuration recommendations for the Agency Implementation System deployment.

## Security Overview

The Agency Implementation System handles sensitive agency data and must maintain high security standards. This guide covers:

1. Authentication and Authorization
2. Data Protection
3. Network Security
4. Secrets Management
5. Auditing and Logging
6. Secure Deployment
7. Vulnerability Management

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API authentication. Configure the following parameters in environment files:

```
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
JWT_EXPIRATION=8h
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
```

Recommendations:
- Use a secret of at least 32 random characters
- Rotate the secret regularly (every 30-90 days)
- Set reasonable expiration times (4-8 hours for normal use)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements RBAC with the following roles:
- Admin: Full system access
- Agency Admin: Full access to agency-specific resources
- User: Read-only access to specific agencies
- Public: Access to public datasets only

Configure RBAC in the database initialization script:

```sql
-- Example RBAC permission setup
INSERT INTO agency_system.permissions (role, resource, action)
VALUES 
('admin', '*', '*'),
('agency_admin', 'agency/{own_agency}/*', '*'),
('user', 'agency/{own_agency}/reports', 'read'),
('public', 'agency/*/public_data', 'read');
```

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For production deployments, enable MFA:

```
# In foundation.env
MFA_ENABLED=true
MFA_METHOD=totp  # Time-based One-Time Password
```

## Data Protection

### Database Encryption

1. **Encryption at Rest**

   Configure PostgreSQL data encryption:

   ```
   # In docker-compose.yaml
   postgres:
     environment:
       - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--data-checksums
     volumes:
       - ./config/pg_encrypt.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf
   ```

   pg_encrypt.conf settings:
   ```
   # Enable encryption
   db_encryption = on
   db_encryption_mode = aes-xts
   db_encryption_key = /etc/postgresql/keys/db_key.key
   ```

2. **Sensitive Data Encryption**

   Encrypt sensitive fields in the application:

   ```
   # In foundation.env and other service configs
   DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<base64-encoded-encryption-key>
   DATA_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=AES-256-GCM
   ```

### TLS/SSL Configuration

Configure HTTPS for all services:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yaml
services:
  foundation-api:
    volumes:
      - ./config/ssl/foundation-api.crt:/app/ssl/server.crt
      - ./config/ssl/foundation-api.key:/app/ssl/server.key
    environment:
      - ENABLE_SSL=true
      - SSL_CERT_PATH=/app/ssl/server.crt
      - SSL_KEY_PATH=/app/ssl/server.key
```

For production, use a valid certificate from a trusted CA rather than self-signed certificates.

## Network Security

### Network Isolation

Implement network isolation using Docker's network features:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yaml
networks:
  frontend_network:
    driver: bridge
  backend_network:
    driver: bridge
  database_network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  dashboard:
    networks:
      - frontend_network
      
  foundation-api:
    networks:
      - frontend_network
      - backend_network
      
  postgres:
    networks:
      - database_network
      - backend_network
```

### Firewall Configuration

Set up a firewall to restrict access to necessary ports only:

```bash
# Example iptables rules
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT  # Dashboard
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT  # Foundation API (if public)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT    # SSH
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP                        # Drop all other incoming traffic
```

### Rate Limiting

Configure rate limiting to prevent abuse:

```
# In foundation.env
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=15m
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
RATE_LIMIT_STRATEGY=ip
```

## Secrets Management

### Environment Variables

Store secrets in environment files outside of version control:

```bash
# Create environment files securely
openssl rand -base64 32 > ./config/secrets/jwt_secret.txt
openssl rand -base64 32 > ./config/secrets/encryption_key.txt

# Reference in environment files
JWT_SECRET=$(cat ./config/secrets/jwt_secret.txt)
DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(cat ./config/secrets/encryption_key.txt)
```

For production, use a dedicated secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Docker Secrets.

### Docker Secrets (Swarm Mode)

When using Docker Swarm, utilize Docker Secrets:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml with secrets
secrets:
  jwt_secret:
    file: ./config/secrets/jwt_secret.txt
  db_password:
    file: ./config/secrets/db_password.txt

services:
  foundation-api:
    secrets:
      - jwt_secret
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/jwt_secret
```

## Auditing and Logging

### Audit Logging

Enable comprehensive audit logging:

```
# In foundation.env
AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=info
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION=90
```

Audit logs should capture:
- User authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Resource access and modifications
- Administrative actions
- Federation data requests

### Structured Logging

Configure structured logging for easier analysis:

```
# In foundation.env and other service configs
LOG_FORMAT=json
LOG_INCLUDE_CONTEXT=true
LOG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT=ISO8601
```

### Log Storage and Rotation

Set up log rotation and secure storage:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yaml
services:
  foundation-api:
    volumes:
      - log_volume:/var/log/foundation
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"
```

For production, send logs to a centralized logging system like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.

## Secure Deployment

### Container Hardening

Implement container security best practices:

1. **Run containers as non-root**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     foundation-api:
       user: "1000:1000"
   ```

2. **Set filesystem to read-only where possible**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     foundation-api:
       read_only: true
       tmpfs:
         - /tmp
         - /var/cache
   ```

3. **Limit container capabilities**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     foundation-api:
       cap_drop:
         - ALL
       cap_add:
         - NET_BIND_SERVICE
   ```

4. **Configure resource limits**:
   ```yaml
   services:
     foundation-api:
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: '0.5'
             memory: 512M
   ```

### Security Scanning

Integrate security scanning into your deployment process:

1. **Image Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Example using Trivy scanner
   trivy image foundation-api:latest
   ```

2. **Dependency Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Example scanning for package vulnerabilities
   npm audit --audit-level=high
   ```

3. **Infrastructure as Code Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Example using TFSec for Terraform
   tfsec ./terraform
   ```

## Vulnerability Management

### Updating Dependencies

Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# In deployment scripts
npm audit fix
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Security Patches

Implement a process for applying security patches:

1. Monitor security advisories for all components
2. Test patches in a staging environment
3. Schedule regular maintenance windows for updates
4. Maintain a rollback plan for failed updates

### Security Testing

Implement regular security testing:

1. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct penetration tests at least annually
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run automated vulnerability scans weekly
3. **Security Code Reviews**: Review security-critical code changes
4. **Compliance Checks**: Verify compliance with security standards

## Security Checklist

## Incident Response Plan

In case of a security incident:

1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
   ```bash
   # Example: Isolate a compromised service
   docker-compose stop compromised-service
   ```

2. **Evidence Collection**: Preserve logs and system state
   ```bash
   # Example: Create forensic snapshot
   ./scripts/create-forensic-snapshot.sh
   ```

3. **Analysis**: Determine cause and impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems securely
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve
