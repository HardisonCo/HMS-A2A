## Core Components

The system consists of six integrated components:

### 1. Adaptive Sampling

The adaptive sampling component optimizes surveillance resource allocation using response-adaptive strategies:

- **Risk-Based Allocation:** Directs resources to high-risk areas based on environmental factors
- **Response-Adaptive Sampling:** Dynamically adjusts allocation based on detection history
- **Thompson Sampling:** Balances exploration and exploitation for optimal surveillance
- **Adaptive Algorithms:** Implements multi-armed bandit algorithms adapted from clinical trials

This component translates the concept of response-adaptive randomization from clinical trials to spatial resource allocation for surveillance.

### 2. Outbreak Detection

The outbreak detection component provides early warning of emerging outbreaks using statistical methods:

- **Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT):** Continuously evaluates evidence for outbreaks
- **Group Sequential Testing:** Implements O'Brien-Fleming and Pocock boundaries for early detection
- **CUSUM Analysis:** Detects shifts in detection rates over time
- **Spatial Cluster Detection:** Identifies geographic clusters of cases

This component adapts group sequential testing methods from clinical trials to enable early outbreak detection with strong statistical control.

### 3. Predictive Modeling

The predictive modeling component forecasts disease spread using ensemble approaches:

- **Distance-Based Models:** Simulate proximity-based transmission
- **Network-Based Models:** Incorporate migration routes and trade networks
- **Gaussian Process Models:** Model complex spatiotemporal patterns
- **Ensemble Forecasting:** Combines multiple models for robust predictions

This component adapts Bayesian adaptive designs from clinical trials to enable dynamic updating of prediction models as new data becomes available.

### 4. Notification System

The notification system delivers alerts through multiple channels:

- **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Email, SMS, and webhook notifications
- **Role-Based Content:** Customized notifications based on recipient type
- **Delivery Tracking:** Monitors receipt and response to alerts
- **Alert Types:** Outbreak detection, risk prediction, and system notifications

This component ensures rapid communication of critical information to stakeholders.

### 5. Visualization Services

The visualization services component provides situational awareness through interactive visuals:

- **Geographic Maps:** Cases, risk levels, clusters, and transmission networks
- **Trend Charts:** Temporal patterns and distributions
- **Comprehensive Dashboards:** Integrated views of system data
- **Custom Visualizations:** Specialized views for different stakeholders

This component translates complex data into actionable intelligence for decision-makers.

### 6. Genetic Analysis

The genetic analysis component analyzes viral genomics and transmission dynamics:

- **Sequence Analysis:** Mutation identification, lineage assessment, and phylogenetics
- **Antigenic Analysis:** Prediction of antigenic properties and vaccine effectiveness
- **Zoonotic Assessment:** Evaluation of human transmission risk
- **Transmission Analysis:** Network inference, cluster identification, and pattern assessment

This component provides critical insights into viral evolution and spread mechanisms.
