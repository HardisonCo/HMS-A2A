# APHIS Bird Flu Tracking System

A next-generation avian influenza surveillance and outbreak detection system built using adaptive methodologies from clinical trials.

## Overview

The APHIS Bird Flu Tracking System is a comprehensive platform for monitoring, detecting, and responding to avian influenza outbreaks. The system leverages advanced adaptive techniques from clinical trial methodologies to optimize surveillance resources, detect outbreaks earlier, and coordinate effective responses.

Key features include:

- **Adaptive Sampling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on risk and detection patterns
- **Early Outbreak Detection**: Statistical algorithms for rapid detection of potential outbreaks
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting outbreak spread using spatial and network models
- **Real-time Notifications**: Multi-channel alerting for stakeholders
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Spatial-temporal clustering and visualization
- **Genomic Integration**: Viral strain tracking and transmission pathway analysis
- **Mobile Field Collection**: Real-time data collection with offline capabilities

## Project Status

This project is currently in Phase 1 (Foundation) of development. The core system architecture and initial components are being implemented.

For detailed progress information, see [APHIS-PROGRESS-TRACKING.md](../APHIS-PROGRESS-TRACKING.md).

## Architecture

The system follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with a standardized domain structure:

## Core Components

### Adaptive Sampling

The adaptive sampling component dynamically allocates surveillance resources based on risk levels and previous detection patterns. It implements several strategies:

- **Risk-Based Sampling**: Allocates resources based on site risk levels
- **Response-Adaptive Sampling**: Adjusts allocation based on previous detection results
- **Thompson Sampling**: Uses multi-armed bandit optimization for exploration-exploitation balance

### Outbreak Detection

The outbreak detection component implements statistical methods for early detection:

- **Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)**: Early detection based on Wald's sequential analysis
- **Group Sequential Detection**: Multi-stage testing with defined boundaries
- **CUSUM Detection**: Detects shifts in the mean of a process
- **Spatiotemporal Scan**: Detects spatial-temporal clusters of cases

### Predictive Modeling

The predictive modeling component forecasts the spread of avian influenza outbreaks:

- **Distance-Based Spread Models**: Predicts spread based on proximity to existing cases
- **Network-Based Spread Models**: Predicts spread through network connections (migration routes, trade)
- **Gaussian Process Spatiotemporal Models**: Advanced spatiotemporal modeling with uncertainty quantification
- **Ensemble Forecasting**: Combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy

### Notification System

The notification component delivers real-time alerts to stakeholders:

- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Sends alerts via email, SMS, and webhooks
- **Customizable Templates**: Formats notifications based on alert type and severity
- **Outbreak Alerts**: Immediate notification of detected outbreaks
- **Risk Prediction Alerts**: Notification of high-risk areas for preventive action
- **System Notifications**: Updates on system status and model training

### Visualization Services

The visualization component provides geospatial and data visualizations:

- **Interactive Maps**: Case distribution, risk levels, and surveillance coverage
- **Transmission Network Visualization**: Visual representation of spread pathways
- **Dashboard Generators**: Summary statistics and trend analysis charts
- **Chart Generation**: Case trends, geographic distribution, and subtype breakdowns
- **Surveillance Effectiveness Visualization**: Positivity rates and sampling efficacy

### Case Management

The case management component tracks cases of avian influenza:

- **Case Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of suspected and confirmed cases
- **Sample Management**: Tracking of laboratory samples and results
- **Genetic Sequence Integration**: Management of viral genetic sequences
- **Outbreak Linkage**: Association between related cases
